## Implementation Strategy

### Rapid Response Cycle
1. **Identify**: Categorize and prioritize feedback
2. **Fix**: Implement solutions for critical and high-priority issues
3. **Test**: Verify fixes in development environment
4. **Deploy**: Push updates via Expo OTA updates
5. **Verify**: Confirm resolution with affected users

### Update Schedule
- **Critical Fixes (P0)**: Deploy immediately after testing
- **High Priority (P1)**: Weekly updates
- **Medium Priority (P2)**: Bi-weekly updates
- **Low Priority (P3)**: Final release or post-launch
