# Poker Tracker Geo - Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the Poker Tracker Geo application, focusing on geolocation and tracking features across various devices and platforms.

## Testing Objectives
1. Verify geolocation accuracy and reliability
2. Ensure poker room detection works correctly
3. Validate session tracking functionality
4. Test cross-platform compatibility
5. Identify and resolve edge cases

## Test Environments
- iOS devices (iPhone, iPad)
- Android devices (various screen sizes and OS versions)
- Emulators and simulators for rapid testing

## Test Cases

### Geolocation Testing

#### Basic Location Services
- [ ] Verify location permissions are properly requested

#### Poker Room Detection
- [ ] Verify nearby poker rooms are correctly identified
- [ ] Test distance calculation accuracy
- [ ] Validate sorting of poker rooms by proximity
- [ ] Test behavior when no poker rooms are nearby
- [ ] Verify venue detection when user is at a poker room

#### Map Integration
- [ ] Test map rendering and marker placement
- [ ] Verify user location is correctly displayed on map
- [ ] Test map interaction (zoom, pan, tap)
- [ ] Validate venue selection via map markers
- [ ] Test directions functionality

### Session Tracking Testing

#### Session Creation
- [ ] Test manual session creation
- [ ] Verify automatic venue suggestion when at poker room

- [ ] Validate behavior in remote areas with no poker rooms

#### User Data Edge Cases
- [ ] Test with new user (0 sessions)
- [ ] Verify behavior with free session limit reached
- [ ] Test with large amount of historical data
- [ ] Validate subscription state changes

## Testing Tools
- Expo testing tools
- Jest for unit testing
- React Native Testing Library for component testing
- Manual testing on physical devices
- Geolocation mocking tools

## Bug Reporting Process
1. Identify and document the issue
2. Categorize by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. Include steps to reproduce
4. Attach screenshots or videos when applicable
5. Document device information and environment
6. Track resolution status

## Success Criteria
- All critical and high-severity issues resolved
- Geolocation features work reliably on 95% of test cases
- Session tracking is accurate and consistent
- Application performs well on both iOS and Android
- Edge cases are handled gracefully
