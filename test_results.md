# Poker Tracker Geo - Test Results

## Overview
This document captures the results of testing the Poker Tracker Geo application across various devices and platforms, with a focus on geolocation and tracking features.

## Test Environment
- iOS Simulator (iPhone 13, iOS 15.4)
- Android Emulator (Pixel 4, Android 12)
- Expo development environment

## Geolocation Testing Results

### Basic Location Services
- ✅ Location permissions are properly requested on both iOS and Android
- ✅ Location acquisition works in foreground
- ⚠️ Background location updates need optimization on Android
- ✅ Location accuracy is sufficient in simulated urban environments
- ✅ App properly handles disabled location services with clear user messaging

### Poker Room Detection
- ✅ Nearby poker rooms are correctly identified based on location
- ✅ Distance calculation matches expected results
- ✅ Poker rooms are properly sorted by proximity
- ✅ Empty state is displayed when no poker rooms are nearby
- ⚠️ Venue detection threshold may need adjustment (currently set at 100m)

### Map Integration
- ✅ Map renders correctly with proper styling
- ✅ User location marker is accurately positioned
- ✅ Poker room markers are placed at correct coordinates
- ✅ Venue selection via map markers works as expected
- ⚠️ Map performance could be improved on lower-end devices

## Session Tracking Testing Results

### Session Creation
- ✅ Manual session creation works for all venue types
- ✅ Venue suggestion appears when simulating being at a poker room
- ✅ All venue type options function correctly
- ✅ Game type selection works as expected
- ✅ Financial calculations are accurate

### Session Management
- ✅ Sessions are properly listed and can be filtered
- ✅ Session details display all relevant information
- ✅ Session editing functionality works correctly
- ✅ Session deletion works with confirmation
- ⚠️ Performance may degrade with very large number of sessions (100+)

### Analytics
- ✅ Profit/loss calculations are accurate
- ✅ Analytics filtering by time period works correctly
- ✅ Game type performance metrics display as expected
- ✅ Venue performance metrics are accurate
- ⚠️ Tax report generation needs additional testing with edge cases

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

### iOS-Specific
- ✅ Core functionality works on iOS simulator
- ⚠️ Need to test on physical iOS devices
- ⚠️ iPad layout needs optimization

### Android-Specific
- ✅ Core functionality works on Android emulator
- ⚠️ Need to test on physical Android devices
- ⚠️ Some UI elements need adjustment for different screen densities

## Edge Cases Tested

### Network Conditions
- ✅ App functions with simulated slow network
- ⚠️ Offline mode functionality is limited and needs improvement
- ⚠️ Data synchronization after reconnection needs more robust handling

### Location Edge Cases
- ✅ App handles simulated poor GPS signal gracefully
- ⚠️ Rapid location changes need more testing
- ✅ Remote areas with no poker rooms show appropriate messaging

### User Data Edge Cases
- ✅ New user experience works as expected
- ✅ Free session limit is properly enforced
- ⚠️ Performance with large historical datasets needs optimization

## Identified Issues

### Critical Issues
1. None identified in current testing

### High Priority Issues
1. Background location tracking on Android needs optimization
2. Offline mode functionality is limited

### Medium Priority Issues
1. Map performance on lower-end devices
2. iPad layout optimization
3. Data synchronization after network reconnection

### Low Priority Issues
1. UI adjustments for different Android screen densities
2. Venue detection threshold may need fine-tuning
3. Performance optimization for large datasets

## Next Steps
1. Address high priority issues before user testing
2. Conduct testing on physical devices
3. Implement fixes for medium priority issues
4. Prepare for user feedback validation
5. Document remaining known issues for future iterations
